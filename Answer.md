Answer
------
1. Switching SW2 displays a joke on the LCD display 
2. When SW3 is up the joke changes on SW2
3. BTNR: makes LEDs cycle in order
4. BTNL: Makes LEDs count as a binary counter
5. BTNU: Makes all LEDs light up
6. BTNC: Makes 4 LEDs light up and shifts them to the right wrapping around the left
7. At 115200 BAUD the USB serial port shows a zooming portrait
8. On VGA output when SW0 is toggled displays a moving banner which reads “All Hail CprE 488’s Malevolent Benevolent Ruler”
9. On VGA output when SW0 and SW1 is toggled shows a moving banner with pictures of Jones
10. JA1 Has Morris code being broadcast at AM frequency 1560 kHz
11. JB1 has a UART signal on it outputting: “Congratulations – this is not an easy message to read. I am somewhat impressed.”
12. Holding down BTND and toggling switches cause the associated LEDs to light up
13. Missing mode: when toggling switches to ‘42’ the screen does NOT display “The answer to life, the universe, and everything”
